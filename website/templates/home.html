        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>
            Planning workouts involves several key steps to ensure effective 
            and structured training sessions. 
            <br><br>
            Firstly, it's crucial to establish 
            your fitness goals, whether they're focused on strength, endurance, 
            weight loss, or overall fitness. Next, consider your current fitness 
            level and any specific limitations or considerations you may have. 
            With these factors in mind, you can then select appropriate exercises and 
            create a balanced routine that targets different muscle groups and 
            includes cardiovascular activities. 
            <br><br>
            It's important to gradually progress 
            the intensity and volume of your workouts to avoid injury and plateaus. 
            Additionally, scheduling rest days and incorporating variety into your 
            routine helps prevent boredom and keeps you motivated. 
            Regularly tracking your progress and making adjustments as needed will 
            ensure continuous improvement and optimize your workout plan for long-term success.
